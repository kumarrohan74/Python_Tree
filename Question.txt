Consider Red lines of slope -1 passing between nodes (in following diagram). The diagonal sum in a binary tree is the sum of all nodeâ€™s data lying between these lines. Given a Binary Tree of size N, print all diagonal sums.

For the following input tree, output should be 9, 19, 42.
9 is sum of 1, 3 and 5.
19 is sum of 2, 6, 4 and 7.
42 is sum of 9, 10, 11 and 12.
